        <h2>Currently working on...</h2>
        <p>I am currently re-brushing and learning new technical skill-sets in Web development, specifically in HTML5, CSS and Javascript. Also learning Front-end Javascript framework such as React.js</p>
        <p>As of today, I am able to deploy a working production-ready web application written in HTML, CSS and React.js.</p>
        <p>Here is the quick code snippet from my small Robofriends application where user is able to search through a list of Robots.</p>
        <p>In code below, I am using Javascript arrow function to render my a CardList component by using Array’s map function on my robots list so that a list of Robots is displayed with information such as name, username and email.</p>
        <p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              const CardList = ({ robots }) => {
                return (
                  {    
                    robots.map(user => {
                      return (
                        <Card 
                          key={user.id}
                          name={user.name} 
                          username={user.username} 
                          email={user.email} 
                        />
                      )
                    })
                  }

        <p>For the past three to four months, I am fully emerged in learning and practicing in web development by implementing small web applications with Front-End tech stacks which I learned from Zero-To-Mastery: Web development course on Udemy.</p>
        <p>I am looking forward to apply my knowledge and work experience in interesting projects and hopefully join a great company with interesting projects in Web, Mobile and Cloud development.</p>

        <div class="employment employment1">
          <h3><em>3PL IT Operations Specialist</em></h3>
          <p><em>Your Logistics Partner LLP, Almaty, Kazakhstan | June 2020 - December 2020</em></p>
          <p>I initiated, started and worked on a 3PL Service project under supervision of a company CEO. This service helped current Retail Chain Store Customers to better serve their regional retail stores, to store, ship and deliver frozen goods and beverages safely and on time to their regional retail stores and storage locations.</p>
          <p>I used internal software systems such as “УСУ”(Universal Operations and Systems Application) and Online Excel Sheets to dispatch and control truck loads, shipping request, delivery and truck management and fleet dispatch. I implemented a Kanban board by using the tool Bitrix24 for Customer Relationship Management and task progress and activity tracking.</p>
          <p>The 3PL Service project was planned for more than a year but was never executed until June 2020, and never worked as expected due to lack of responsible team, expertise in LTL/3PL services and well aligned IT Operations and customer support teams. As a result, due to operational efficiency and team effort, the 3PL team was able to profitably serve and acquire LTL customers on a weekly basis.</p>

          <p>Plan, organize and execute online digital marketing strategy for online educational platforms such as Bilimland, iTest, iMektep, Twig-Bilim. Platforms are dedicated and aimed to better serve government schools, and assist with educational content in rural regions and schools without enough educational materials and supplies for students and teachers to study and teach.</p>
          <p>I used digital advertising strategy and tools such as Search Engine Optimization(SEO), Google Ads and Yandex Direct(for pay per click campaigns)) advertising and Social Media marketing channels such as Facebook, Instagram and Vkontakte and Facebook Ads Manager platforms, internal Enterprise Resource Management System - RMS. Also I hired and assembled a team of specialists for roles such as Digital marketing manager for SEO & Ads campaigns, Copywriter(Kazakh and Russian spoken), SMM manager, and PR manager. For each Ad campaign and advertising activity, I used Kanban boards and cards to control flow and progress of each task from initiation to completion.</p>
          <p>Due to fast team and product line expansion, the company’s urgent need was to have a Digital Marketing Team to execute all Digital and Marketing activities. As a result, the marketing team achieved 30 000 Daily Active Users in a period of 8 to 10 months, was able to organize offline events every quarter for 500 teachers from all regions and create a better feedback cycle and support to the needs of users.</p>

          <p><em>Bilim Media Group LLP, Almaty, Kazakhstan | November 2016 - November 2017</em></p>
          <p>I worked with a team of web developers, designers, system-administrators and digital content creators, to rebuild existing online platforms such as Bilimland, iTest, iMektep, Twig-Bilim., online interactive lessons, internal software tools and back-end development and deployment architecture and technology stacks. I also personally interviewed and hired web developers and designers.</p>
          <p>For project management purposes, I used a hybrid model of Waterfall and Agile Software development methodologies. Tools I used, Atlassian Jira Software for project backlog and tasks tracking, Scrum/Kanban boards to keep track of tasks implementation and developer’s task load.</p>
          <p>I implemented Scrum and Kanban methodology so that our team of twelve developers and designers can progressively and transparently work in sprints with 2-3 weeks periods, with sub-divided Backlog tasks which came from upper management and CEO acting as a Product owner.</p>
          <p>As a result, during periods of 5 to 6 months, we successfully re-implemented and used technologies such as PHP programming language, Laravel framework, SQL databases, Node.js to re-write all legacy technology-stacks, which was written in Joomla framework-platform. Also for content creation, we used HTML5, CSS, and React.js library to re-implement the front-end stack.</p>

On a daily basis, directly report to the Project manager via email about current on-going tasks and work completed during the day.</p>
          <p>Due to customer’s high server loads and frequent system updates and maintenance requirements, customers required all interconnected systems and server architecture to be up to date and running without any halts.</p>
